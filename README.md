The DAV CLI tool is here to make developing applications and solutions that interact with DAV a much more pleasant experience.

### Features:

* Easily run a local Ethereum node containing DAV contracts
* Easily scaffold a new project, or modify an existing one to interact with DAV (under development)
* More coming soon

## Installation

To get started, install `dav-cli` globally using either of the following commands:

```bash

```

*NOTE: DAV CLI is written in and installed using Node.js but is useful not just for Node.js or JavaScript development.*
