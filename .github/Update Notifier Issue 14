## Motivation and Context
This change will notify users when their version of dav-cli is out of date.  It will be important during the rapid development cycle that users be aware when their version is not up to date.

## How Has This Been Tested?
The update-notifier was tested by running against versions that both required and update and versions that did not.  The update-notifier acted according, only showing the notifier when the dav-cli was out of date compared to the most current version.
